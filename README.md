# WWDC "7" Banner

Created using HTML & CSS.

## Note: webkit only

Since this example uses webkit-specific filters, it won't look right in anything but Chrome and Safari currently.

See [a live demo](http://hop.ie/seven). It should look something like this:

<a href="http://hop.ie/seven"><img src="http://hop.ie/seven/images/example.jpg" /></a>

Update: Since the keynote, I've added a white app icon-style background

## Inspiration

It's based on this banner from WWDC 2013:

<img src="http://hop.ie/seven/images/banner.jpeg?1" />
