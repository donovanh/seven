# WWDC "7" Banner

Created using HTML & CSS.

## Note: webkit only

Since this example uses webkit-specific filters, it won't look right in anything but Chrome and Safari currently.

See [a live demo](http://hop.ie/seven). It should look something like this:

<a href="http://hop.ie/seven"><img src="http://hop.ie/seven/images/example.jpg" /></a>

Update: Since the keynote, I've added a white app icon-style background

Update 2: Keith Chu (twitter: @Catharsis / github: keithchu) has been kind enough to make an amazing lighter version of the CSS. I've added it to this repo as "lighter.html" and "screen_lighter.sass/css". Thanks!


## Inspiration

It's based on this banner from WWDC 2013:
